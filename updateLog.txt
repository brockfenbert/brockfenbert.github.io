4/4
Starting to make a serious attempt at finishing up this website.

10/25/18
Basic formatting of website created.  Navigation bar with dropdown menu for (non-working) link to projects page and a
    link back to the home page.  Could not get the GitHub and Email images to center properly, so for now they are
    commented out and replaced with a simple text.  Project images do not have working links to separate project
    pages with descriptions of what they were about.  Planet Polluter links to the Unity WebGl build.  Resume link is
    not currently online, but will be added sometime over this weekend.  Also going to work on getting a photo next to
    the bio and a working project page/description pages.
